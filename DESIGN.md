  - Clear reading hierarchy

## 4. Implementation Layer

### A. Component Patterns

#### Layout Components

- Responsive Navigation (top)
- Responsive Grid System
- Modal Overlays

#### Content Components

- Cards with elevation
- Lists with clear item separation
- Tabs for content categorization

#### Interactive Components

- Buttons with hover and active states
- Form elements with clear labels and help text
- Icons to aid recognition

### B. Technical Specifications

#### Spacing System

- Base unit: 8px
- Spacing scale: Multiples of 8px (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64)

#### Color System

- Primary color: #1D4ED8 (Blue)
- Secondary color: #9333EA (Purple)
- Accent color: #F59E0B (Amber)
- Neutral colors: Shades of gray for backgrounds and borders
- Feedback colors:
  - Success: #10B981 (Green)
  - Error: #EF4444 (Red)
  - Warning: #F59E0B (Amber)

#### Typography Scale

- Font family: 'Noto Sans Arabic', sans-serif
- Font sizes:
  - Heading 1: 32px
  - Heading 2: 24px
  - Heading 3: 20px
  - Body: 16px
  - Small: 14px
- Font weights:
  - Regular: 400

  - Reduced opacity
  - Cursor changes to not-allowed

#### Responsive Approach

- Mobile-first design
- Breakpoints:
  - Small (sm): 640px
  - Medium (md): 768px
  - Large (lg): 1024px
  - Extra Large (xl): 1280px
- Layout adjustments at each breakpoint
- Components adapt to screen size (e.g., navigation transforms from hamburger menu on mobile to full menu on desktop)

## Application Process

1. **Strategy Definition**
   - Maintained core values: Clarity, Simplicity, Warmth
   - Ensured Accessibility is the top priority
   - Selected key characteristics to guide the user through the app

2. **Theme Selection**
   - Combined Minimalist with touches of Material Design for better hierarchy and depth
   - Ensured the theme aligns with the app's focus on accessibility

3. **Principles Application**
   - Applied clean white space and structured layouts
   - Implemented visual hierarchy using typography and subtle depth
   - Designed interactions to be gentle and informative

4. **Implementation Planning**
   - Refactored components into smaller, reusable pieces
   - Updated technical specifications in Tailwind configuration
   - Ensured all components are responsive and accessible
